                                                <p>a. As a group, we are trying to minimise any risk of financial loss
                                                    to any member by instituting various strategies to remove or
                                                    minimise potential risks. For example, all new members of the group
                                                    collect their bulk funds last and work their way up in subsequent
                                                    cycles until they have accrued sufficient provident funds to also
                                                    allow them to collect their bulk funds early.</p>
                                                <p>b. Before each cycle starts we give the opportunity to members to
                                                    reconsider their savings; either to increase, decrease, suspend or
                                                    leave the group. This flexibility allows members to save relevant
                                                    amounts applicable to their individual circumstances.</p>
                                                <p>c. Once a member decides to leave the group, they can only be
                                                    readmitted to the group after a minimum of 12 months and this will
                                                    be subject to the approval of the board.</p>
                                                <p>d. All members are subject to a percentage deduction from their bulk
                                                    funds within each cycle. This deduction is set at 10% of total
                                                    savings per cycle.</p>
                                                <p class="text-danger">This is not a charge but a safety fund saved on
                                                    behalf of the member. This will be used to cover the member in the
                                                    event of an emergency</p>
                                                <p>e. In the event a member defaults and the money cannot be immediately
                                                    recovered, their accrued provident will be used to cover/offset any
                                                    money they owe.</p>
                                                <p>f. The board reserves the right to ask a member to resign from the
                                                    group should they find or have a reason to believe that such a
                                                    member poses a substantial risk to the group.</p>
                                                <p>g. Any member can recommend a friend and or relation to join the
                                                    group before the beginning of each cycle. The board will ultimately
                                                    decide if this person should be admitted to the group or not.</p>
                                                <p>h. Members have access to their dashboard which has every detail of
                                                    their savings, provident, loans, profits etc. </p>
                                                <p>i. A memberâ€™s dashboard can be accessed by entering the unique ID
                                                    provided to the member during registration. </p>
                                                <p>j. At the end of each cycle, members will be issued with their most
                                                    up-to-date financial statements in the group.</p>
                                                <p>k. If the group decides to invest any capital you hold with the
                                                    group, you will be notified and given the option to opt-in or out

                                                <p>l. The board will make decisions on behalf of the members and in the
                                                    interest of the group.</p>
                                                <p>m. From time to time members will be allowed to sit in board meetings
                                                    as an observer(s). The board will inform members and request for
                                                    expression of interest where this is necessary.</p>
                                                <p>n. As a minimum, the board will hold a general meeting for members
                                                    once a year. The date and time will be communicated to members.</p>
                                                <p>o. In the interest of the group, board members are expected to act
                                                    honestly, professionally and in the fear of God to represent the
                                                    interest of the group.</p>
                                                <p>p. Board members should act in the absolute interest of the group and
                                                    not in a way that will result in any financial loss to the group.

                                                <p>q. Interfriends is a voluntary group and members will be called upon

                                                    governed by policies agreed by the board and which sets out the
                                                    minimum expected behaviour for each of the policy areas. Where
