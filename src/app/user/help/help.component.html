                                <p>Interfriends Group also known as INTERFRIENDS was initially conceived in August 2012 by close family members. At the time it was just bringing equal amounts of money together as a family on a monthly basis. The total collected monthly was meant to be passed around to each member in turn until the circle was completed. </p>
                                <p>From a humble beginning of just 9 close family and friends who started this savings circle, we have steadily grown and evolved to become known as Interfriends with nearly 100 closely connected members.</p>

By joining interfriends, you are expressing trust in our ability to do things together rather than singularly.</p>
                                <p>Interfriends is also about encouraging and promoting the habit of saving money on a regular basis. You and I know how difficult it can sometimes be when we try to save consistently on our own. The beauty of Interfriends is that you are encouraged to save consistently as you see other members doing the same. You will soon realise that saving consistently no matter how small can become a habit.</p>
                                <p>You will also benefit from leveraging our efforts to achieve much more than you alone can achieve.</p>

This maximum amount is also dependent on the amount of provident funds the member has accrued. We will also take into consideration your repayment habit and history  (this is the reason why as a group we operate our own credit scoring system to help us make fair decisions).

For example, rather than going to your friend or family to ask for a small emergency cash help. Just text us, you do not need to explain why you need it and we will send you up to £500 within 24hrs.Every member can qualify for emergency funds twice in the cycle regardless of their financial standing in the group. Emergencies once collected should be returned within 30 days.</p>

Over time, we believe there will be other business ventures that can be spun off from Interfriends provided we keep working together as one core group bounded by a common interest and vision.</p>

                                <p>a. As a group, we are trying to minimise any risk of financial loss to any member by instituting various strategies to remove or minimise potential risks. For example, all new members of the group collect their bulk funds last and work their way up in subsequent cycles until they have accrued sufficient provident funds to also allow them to collect their bulk funds early.</p>
                                <p>b.  Before each cycle starts we give the opportunity to members to reconsider their savings; either to increase, decrease, suspend or leave the group. This flexibility allows members to save relevant amounts applicable to their individual circumstances.</p>
                                <p>c. Once a member decides to leave the group, they can only be readmitted to the group after a minimum of 12 months and this will be subject to the approval of the board.</p>
                                <p>d. All members are subject to a percentage deduction from their bulk funds within each cycle. This deduction is set at 10% of total savings per cycle.</p>
                                <p class="text-danger">This is not a charge but a safety fund saved on behalf of the member. This will be used to cover the member in the event of an emergency</p>
                                <p>e. In the event a member defaults and the money cannot be immediately recovered, their accrued provident will be used to cover/offset any money they owe.</p>
                                <p>f. The board reserves the right to ask a member to resign from the group should they find or have a reason to believe that such a member poses a substantial risk to the group.</p>
                                <p>g.  Any member can recommend a friend and or relation to join the group before the beginning of each cycle. The board will ultimately decide if this person should be admitted to the group or not.</p>
                                <p>h. Members have access to their dashboard which has every detail of their savings, provident, loans, profits etc. </p>
                                <p>i. A member’s dashboard can be accessed by entering the unique ID provided to the member during registration. </p>
                                <p>j. At the end of each cycle, members will be issued with their most up-to-date financial statements in the group.</p>
                                <p>k. If the group decides to invest any capital you hold with the group, you will be notified and given the option to opt-in or out should you wish.</p>
                                <p>l. The board will make decisions on behalf of the members and in the interest of the group.</p>
                                <p>m. From time to time members will be allowed to sit in board meetings as an observer(s). The board will inform members and request for expression of interest where this is necessary.</p>
                                <p>n. As a minimum, the board will hold a general meeting for members once a year. The date and time will be communicated to members.</p>
                                <p>o. In the interest of the group, board members are expected to act honestly, professionally and in the fear of God to represent the interest of the group.</p>
                                <p>p. Board members should act in the absolute interest of the group and not in a way that will result in any financial loss to the group.</p>
                                <p>q. Interfriends is a voluntary group and members will be called upon from time to time support with their time and resource</p>
                                <p>r. Members may be allowed to become board members on a rolling basis and for a set period to be decided.</p>
                                <p>s. Interfriends is governed by a board that run and makes key decisions on behalf of the group.</p>
                                <p>t. In the interest of the whole membership, Interfriends will be governed by policies agreed by the board and which sets out the minimum expected behaviour for each of the policy areas. Where appropriate, policies will be shared with the members of the group.</p>
